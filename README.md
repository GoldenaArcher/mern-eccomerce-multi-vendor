# 🛒 MERN Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform

A full-stack, role-based multi-vendor e-commerce platform built with the MERN stack. The current project provides foundational architecture for user, seller, and admin operations, with major UI components scaffolded and awaiting backend integration. A planned DeepSeek-based LLM assistant will enhance the interactive experience.

## 🚀 Features (In Progress)

### ✅ User, Seller & Admin System

- JWT-based authentication with **Refresh Token auto-renewal**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): `user`, `seller`, `admin`
- Auth logic modularized via custom middleware (`auth`, `role`)
- Distinct login systems for admin and sellers

### 🔄 Product & Shop Management

- Product creation, editing, and listing (backend implemented)
- Shop creation for sellers (backend implemented)
- Category service (backend in progress)

### 🧠 AI Chat Assistant (Planned)

- Socket.IO-based chat UI (UI stub in place)
- LLM integration with local **DeepSeek model** via Ollama (planned)
- Seller-side assistant and smart product Q&A

### 🛠️ Engineering Practices

- TypeScript backend with clean modular layering
- Custom decorators and error handling patterns
- TailwindCSS + component-based layout in React
- RTK Query for API integration; separate RTK store for auth

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```
[Login] → Access Token + HttpOnly Refresh Token
[Access API] → Bearer Token via Middleware
[Token Expired] → Silent refresh via RTKQ logic
[RBAC] → `roleMiddleware` enforces route-level access
```

---

## 🤖 LLM Integration Plan

- Local LLM runtime using `deepseek-coder` via `ollama`
- Backend `chat.service.ts` to proxy frontend requests
- Prompt template-based assistant with domain customization
- Chat UI structure already scaffolded in frontend

---

## 🧪 Local Development Setup

```bash
# After changing Node versions, install this project's package manager
npm install --global yarn@1.22.22

# Install all workspace dependencies
yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Build all seven workspaces
npm run build

# Start backend, storefront, dashboard, and shared-package watchers
npm run dev

# Start MongoDB via Docker Compose (if not already running)
docker compose up -d mongodb

# [Planned] Start LLM container
cd llm && ./run-llm.sh
```

Created by [@GoldenaArcher](https://github.com/GoldenaArcher) to explore scalable full-stack architectures and local LLM integration as preparation for advanced AI-oriented academic research.

### 📋 Engineering Contributions

Originally based on a MERN UI course scaffold, this project was extensively restructured to reflect production-level engineering practices. Key improvements include:

- Migrated backend to TypeScript for stronger type safety
- Replaced Redux Thunk with RTK Query to simplify API state logic
- Implemented secure refresh-token flows and enhanced RBAC enforcement
- Modularized architecture via Turborepo to support multi-role, multi-service development
- Planned and scaffolded integration with DeepSeek LLM (via Ollama) for AI-assisted operations

The result is a maintainable and extensible platform designed to support future features such as real-time chat, advanced admin dashboards, and AI-powered assistant tools.
